# Developing with toolchains
{: #dev_with_toolchains}

Adopt a DevOps approach by using open toolchains in IBM Bluemix.  Toolchains automate the development, deployment, and operations tasks. Toolchains are available on Bluemix Public and Dedicated. You can use a template as a starting point to create a toolchain or you can create a custom toolchain.

To learn more, see [Toolchains](/docs/services/ContinuousDelivery/toolchains_about.html#toolchains_about).
